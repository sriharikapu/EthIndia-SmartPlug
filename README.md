# SMARTPLUG IoT + Blockchain - To incentivize people for saving electricity - (Proof of Concept)

### Problem Statement:
Wastage of electricity has been a major issue in India and the world. With the recent development of smart plugs, which can control the use of any appliance from mobile applications we can control the use of electricity. With the use of smart plugs and blockchain together we can make an ecosystem that incentivizes the user for consuming less electricity.

### How the project idea solves the problem:
We have emulated the smart plug as a test script which invokes the smart contract every 24 hours and records the electricity usage into IPFS. the smart contract calculates the reward for the particular user according to a reward function and pays the user his share of crypto which can be used to pay his electricity bills in future.
